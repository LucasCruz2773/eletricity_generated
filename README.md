## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Time series analysis is crucial for predicting electricity generation trends, which is essential for effective energy management. This notebook focuses on building a predictive model that leverages historical data to forecast future electricity generation.

## Dataset <a name="dataset"></a>

The dataset used in this project contains historical records of electricity generation, including relevant timestamped information. Ensure that the dataset (`eletricity_generated.csv`) is available in the same directory as this notebook.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

Explore the dataset to gain insights into the electricity generation patterns, identify trends, and understand potential seasonality or anomalies.

## Data Preprocessing <a name="data-preprocessing"></a>

Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any other issues that may affect the model's performance.

## Model Development <a name="model-development"></a>

Build and train a time series prediction model using appropriate algorithms such as ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like LSTM or GRU. Tune the model hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>

Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics, considering factors such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Summarize the findings, highlight the model's strengths and limitations, and suggest potential areas for improvement.
